# NFT Analytics Dashboard

Production style React dashboard built during a virtual internship, extending an existing codebase with secure routing, role based access, async UI patterns, and comprehensive testing.

---

## Overview

Extended a React based NFT analytics dashboard in a team environment, implementing authentication flows, multi role user access, resilient async data handling, and component level testing. Built to mirror real world sprint workflows with pull requests, code reviews, and production standards.

---

## Key Features

- **Secure routing** with role-based access control and protected layouts
- **Multi role user flows** supporting different permission levels
- **Async data resilience** with loading states, error boundaries, and pagination
- **Firebase Authentication** integration with guarded routes
- **Comprehensive testing** using Jest and React Testing Library
- **Real time data rendering** with Firestore integration

---

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **React** with modular layout and component composition
- **Protected routing** with role aware access control
- **Async UI state management** for loading, error, and empty states
- **Reusable component patterns** for scalable architecture

### Backend Services
- **Firebase Authentication** for secure user flows
- **Firestore** for real-time data storage and retrieval
- Role-based data access with query scoping

### Testing
- **Jest** for unit testing
- **React Testing Library** for integration testing
